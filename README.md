This small game is the same as the popular game Snake, the difference being, THERE ARE DRAGONS!
And instead of eating only "boring" apples, they prefert to have a nice meal of Chicken McNuggets. - Don't ask how many, they just like them.


The movement follows the arrow keys (all in their respecive positions).

Once you crash and lose you are greated with the "Game Over" screen, [R] is to restart, and [Q] is to quit.
